Raven also created their original Soldier of Fortune series. In 2009 Raven Software made Wolfenstein, a long-awaited sequel to 2001 Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The next year the studio developed their original project - Singularity. Both games sold very poorly, which led Activision to make the studio a support developer for their flagship Call of Duty franchise. Raven worked on more than 10 entries in the series, but in only two of them, it was a primary developer: an exclusive Chinese Call of Duty online and a remaster of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.",
