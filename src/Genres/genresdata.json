It includes a large variety of sub-genres like fighting, beat 'em ups, shooters, survivals, mazes, and platforms; sometimes even multiplayer online battles and real-time strategies. Usually, the player performs as the protagonist with its unique abilities; some games add power-ups along the way. The character aims to complete levels, collect items, avoid obstacles, and battle against antagonists. It's necessary to avoid severe injuries during fights; if the health bar goes low, the player loses. Some games have an unbeatable number of enemies, and the only goal is to maximize score and survive for as long as possible. There might be a boss enemy who appears at the last level; he has unique abilities and a longer health bar. Pong is one of the first action games, released in 1972; the latest include Battlefield, Assasin's Creed, Fortnite and Dark Souls.",

Generally, it describes any title developed by independent (thus the name) studio which means that game's launch was not powered with publisher's funds or any financial support other than crowdfunding. The genre is kickstarted mainly because of the variety of crowd-funding policies and many early-access platforms like Steam Greenlight. A corporation does not develop indies, so primarily the genre is associated with single developers or small studios. Lacking the budget, indie games are mostly shorter and lesser than their publisher-financed competitors. Such titles, therefore, bear no attachment to censorship regulations and can express whatever authors wish. It is worth to mention that a large portion of adult games is indie. The rules above can be applied to the most games; however, not all. Some titles may feature publisher, but it cannot affect the final product. Some specific examples of indie are World of Goo, Undertale, and Braid.",

Each of them has a game master who's in charge of the rules and settings. The video RPGs include sandboxes, like GTA; tactical games, like Dragonfall; and roguelikes, like Mystery Dungeon.

Sub-genre of shooters is also divided by sub-subgenres such as shoot'em ups, tactical shooters, and hero shooters.
